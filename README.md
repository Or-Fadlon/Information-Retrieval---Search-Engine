# Information Retrieval - Search-Engine
## Summery:
As part of our bachelor degree in "Software and Information System Engineering" we took the "Introduction to Information Retrieval" course, This project is the final project in the course ðŸ‘·.

In that course, we acquired knowledge regarding different indexing, retrieval, crawling, and "IR-Engines" evaluation techniques.

In this project, we developed a search engine over [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) data.
We have built the Indexes for out engine using the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) computing power.


## Retrival Methodes:
in this search-engine we have combine several retrival methodes include:
* Inverted Index
* TF-IDF
* cosine simularity
* BM-25
* Page View
* Page Rank

## Indexes:
* Wikipedia title
* Wikipedia body text
* Wikipedia anchor text

## Endpoints
The engine use 6 different endpoints, each endpoint retrival data in a diffarent way:
- **/search?query=??? [Get]-** ??? for your wuery. Use of BM25 method (title and body) for retrival, Use BM-25 score, page-rank and page-view for rating the retrivaled documents.
- **/search_body?query=??? [Get]-** ??? for your query. Use tf-idf and cosine-similarity score to select the best resaults.
- **/search_title?query=??? [Get]-** ??? for your query. Use a terms binary ranking existing in the title.
- **/search_anchor?query=??? [Get]-** ??? for your query. Use a terms binary ranking existing in the anchor text.
- **/get_pageview [POST]-** Insert wiki id's in the request body using the 'json' parameter. Retrive the wiki doc page views (Augoust 2021).
- **/get_pagerank [POST]-** Insert wiki id's in the request body using the 'json' parameter. Retrive the wiki doc page rank.
